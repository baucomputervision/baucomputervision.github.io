We have a paper reading group for all faculty, postgraduates and undergraduates who are affiliated with our lab, where we take turns to present a paper, lead a discussion, or even share interesting topics apart from work. 
We usually meet every week/fortnight at ViPr Lab although we are currently meeting virtually. Drop us an email if you wish to join our sessions. <br><br>
