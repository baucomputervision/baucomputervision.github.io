{% include imagethumbnailblock.html align="left" url="/images/s3dimage.jpg" width="180px" height="120px" padding="right" %}
Consists of 50 stereoscopic images collected from three sources: (1) Images captured with our stereo camera, (2) creative common images from Flickr.com, and images provided by [Niu et al. (2012)](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/project/stereo-warp/). We provide the following three formats for each image: Side-by-side view, anaglyph (red-cyan) view, separate left and right views.
