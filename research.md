## Projects

We have a number of funded and non-funded projects which are currently on-going.

### Large-scale Aesthetic Evaluation of Photographs (LAttE)
{% include imagethumbnailblock.html align="left" url="/images/latte.jpg" width="120px" height="120px" padding="right" %}
Image aesthetic evaluation is a research field which aims to design computationally-driven methods which can automatically rate or predict the perceived aesthetic quality of an image or photograph by learning from image content, photographic rules and other semantic information. We investigate how features can be learned in an unsupervised manner as opposed to traditional hand-crafted rules, and design new deep learning architectures to evaluate the aesthetic beauty of photographs.

## Past Projects
<small>Here's some of our previous completed projects, which are still very much relevant today.</small>

### Aesthetics-driven Stereo Retargeting and Recomposition
{% include imagethumbnailblock.html url="/images/retarget.jpg" width="480px" padding="right" %}
With the recent availability of stereoscopic displays such as 3D monitor, 3D television and stereo camera phone, there is an increasing need for stereo image retargeting and recomposition techniques. Image retargeting aims to resize an image to fit different aspect ratios and sizes while image recomposition attempts to computationally modify the composition of an image to mimic a professional photo. We investigate new aesthetic-driven methods for retargeting and recomposition for stereo image pairs.
